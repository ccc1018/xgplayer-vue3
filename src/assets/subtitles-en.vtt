00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.760
So, according to the analysis,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.760
the two recipients are

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.040
biological relatives.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.960
But not the result

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.040
that you wanted, brother.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.760
I'm sorry, it's so

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.920
hard to accept me.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.160
That can't be it.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.520
His eyes,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.000
they were a different color.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.440
Stop it, Nicholas.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.840
Father.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.760
I said stop it.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.200
After the accident at sea,

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.680
David nearly lost his sight.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.080
You have no idea what

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.120
your brother endured.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.320
And you know what?

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.720
Ironically, David had surgery

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.680
to save his vision.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.480
But the only blind one here is you.
